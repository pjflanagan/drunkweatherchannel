1. A user loads the page and is prompted to turn on location services 
2. Once they approve location services
    1. Load a GIF or a map of where they are as the background
    2. Load the weather in the area (we do not show them yet)
3. We then ask how many drinks they have had
    1. Sir, have you been drinking tonight?
    2. You must be 21, I mean plenty drunk you use this site
4. We then comment on how drunk they are using a GIF
    1. Stone cold sober
    2. Buzzed, respectable, very mature of you
    3. Someone’s not trying to save money at the club
    4. Damn, you pregame hard
    5. Are you okay? 
    6. Woah slow down there
5. Show a GIF of weather and say right now it is…
    1. 54 and drizzling in your area
    2. 58 and breezy in your area
6. But for you it feels like… 
    1. 68, now that looks like summer
    2. 58, practically the same
7. So you probably should
    1. Bring a jacket
    2. Ditch the jacket, you’re gonna lose it at the bar anyway
    3. Taxi there, not to mention you’re drunk
